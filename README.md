# About This Project

This project was created as an experiment to investigate developing React components as only pure components, with state
managed separately. The idea is that code would be cleaner, and that by separating view and state, one developer could
work purely on how the component looks/rendered, while another handled logic/state. In addition, I felt that testing
might be cleaner and easier.

This project utilizes `react-scripts` and `storybook` and is written in TypeScript.
